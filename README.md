# Iris_Flower CLassifier
 
This project will classify iris flowers based on the given inputs into their respectives species
The algorithm is implemented from using Sequential neural network with categorical cross-entropy as the accuracy metric

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species.

Classification is done on features:
1. sepal length
2. sepal width
3. petal length
4. petal width (all in the same unit of centimeters).

The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor or Iris-virginica.
